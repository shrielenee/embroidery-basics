# Stitching basics

There are _a lot_ of embroidery stitches to choose from and a ton of resources on the internet to peruse. I am not attempting to recreate any of those amazing resources, but I compiled some here that could be useful as you learn to stitch.

I am not a professional or career stitcher, but I have learned which stitches and hacks work best for me. Other stitches and techniques may be your favorites! Use my suggestions as a guide and base from which to explore and learn what works best for you.

## Knot and thread your needle

Your stitching design is prepped and ready, so now it's time to get your needle and floss ready to rock.

Before threading your floss through your needle, tie a double knot at one end.

When I started stitching, I really struggled to get the damn embroidery floss through my embroidery needle eye---And I'm not the only one! It's tricky business, but there is a hack that you will thank (nay, PRAISE) me for later.

Enter the... pinch and press method!

To thread the non-knotted end of your embroidery floss through your needle:

1. Loop the end of thread over the sharper/smaller end of the needle.
1. Just underneath the needle, pinch the loop tightly between your thumb and forefinger.
1. Remove the needle from the tight loop, pinching to allow only a teeny tiny portion of the loop to poke up above your pinched fingers.
1. Turn the needle around and carefully place your teeny tiny loop through the eye of the needle. If you've pinched it small enough, it should slide right in.
1. Pull the loop through, leaving a tail of several inches.

If all else fails, lick the end of your floss and try to poke it through the eye. I promise you the above method is easier and faster, though.

## Common stitches

It's time to dive right into stitching. I've listed some of my favorite and most-used stitches below, but do some Googling---The wild world of embroidery stitches is vast.

### Backstitch

This is [my most-used stitch](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/how-to-back-stitch). It produces clean outlines and straight lines and I just find it pleasing to look at.

### Reverse chain stitch

The [reverse chain stitch](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/how-to-chain-stitch) saved my chain stitch life. I could not, for the life of me, get the regular chain stitch to work easily and look right. When I finally did some internet research and tried the reverse chain, I breathed a sigh of relief.

### Stem stitch

This one is pretty. It's great for outlines, vines and leafy stuff, or anything you want to [look clean but have some texture](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/how-to-stem-stitch).

### Running stitch

Running stitch is the [simplest of stitches](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/working-the-running-stitch-1177571). It requires some calibration of spaces to make it look even, but really is so simple. This one might be good to start with! Then move on to the [backstitch](#backstitch).

### French knot

Some people love it, and some people hate it. I happen to _love_ [the french knot](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/how-to-french-knot). It can be painful to master (it's all about that tension, yo), but once you do it will be your funky, bumpy friend. I love to fill a space with french knots, scatter them about artistically, or accentuate my designs.

### Split stitch

[Split stitch](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/how-to-split-stitch) is performed when you split an equal number of strands while stitching. It really adds some nice texture and can also look stellar in lettering or as a filler.

### Seed stitch

Fun! Simple! Cute! [Seed stitch](https://createwhimsy.com/projects/embroidery-seed-stitch/) is your easy-to-hang-with friend. Fill a space, putter around your embroidery fabric space, or add some texture with this stitch. It's even more fun if you use multiple colors to achieve a confetti-type look.

### Satin stitch

I love the way [satin stitch](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/how-to-satin-stitch) looks and fills spaces. But for whatever reason, I have the hardest time making it look precise. It's an often used stitch by embroiderers! But I can never make it look as exacting as I want to.

## Fix mistakes

Mistakes in embroidery, just like with any fiber or fabric art, are inevitable. You don't always keep the back of your work neat and clean, with no knotted up swathes of floss. Sometimes you make a hole in your fabric because you tried to force a french knot. Sometimes, every once in a while, everything becomes a complete tangled wad of floss and you just want to un-hoop it and toss it in the trash can.

Before you do that... wait! You may be able to save your work. See the below sections for fixes to common embroidery problems.

### Fabric is warped

If your fabric, whether on or off the hoop, looks warped or stretched so thin that the fibers are separating or losing form, you may have mounted your fabric too tightly in the hoop.

If you just started stitching, simply un-mount the fabric, mount it back in the hoop a bit more loosely. Tighten the hoop screws just enough to get a taut fabric canvas to work with.

> _**Tip!**_ Take the fabric out of the hoop after you're done stitching each day. Leaving it in the hoop for long periods of time may cause warping or permanent hoop lines on your fabric. Roll it up neatly and store it away from dirt, your pets, your grubby hands, or anything else that may dirty the fabric.

### Backside is tangled

So, you did the whole "the back of my embroidery is a tangled mess" trick, eh? Chill. It will be alright.

Unthread your working floss from your needle. Use your needle to gently pull out each stitch, one after another, so you can back it up and unknot it.

If you have to tie off your floss, cut it, and start again, that's okay! Gentle rip out each stitch, working from back to front (or reverse), being careful not to tear your fabric.

If all else fails, use your tiny scissors to snip the stitching every few stitches and pull it out with your fingers until you can tie a piece off (to secure the _good_ stitches still in the fabric). Remove as many stitches as you need to so you can re-stitch where you need to and continue on!

### French knot created a hole

Now, this one is a doozy. Sometimes, when you are attempting to make a french knot that is a little too big for your fabric, you pull the knot through too hard and it rips the knot right from the front to the back of your fabric, creating a big hole.

If the hole is small enough, you may be able to back your french knot out and create a new one adjacent to the hole (and smaller, so you don't create another stitch blowout) that covers the existing hole.

If the hole is pretty darn big you may be able to use another stitch and stitch right over it to cover it. If you can't do that, you may have to start over. Be gentle with your stitches, friends!

### Hate my stitch choice

So, you decided to try a split stitch but either the stitch or the number of strands you picked doesn't look right. No worries! Treat this similarly to the [Backside is tangled issue](#backside-is-tangled)---Remove your stitches and start again!

### Hate my floss color choice

This is troublesome, but not a giant issue. Simply [remove your stitching](#backside-is-tangled), select a new color, and start again.
