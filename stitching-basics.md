# Stitching basics

There are _a lot_ of embroidery stitches to choose from and a ton of resources on the internet to peruse. I am not attempting to recreate any of those amazing resources, but I compiled some here that could be useful as you learn to stitch.

I am not a professional or career stitcher, but I have learned which stitches and hacks work best for me. Other stitches and techniques may be your favorites! Use my suggestions as a guide and base from which to explore and learn what works best for you.

## Knot and thread your needle

Your stitching design is prepped and ready, so now it's time to get your needle and floss ready to rock.

Before threading your floss through your needle, tie a double knot at one end.

When I started stitching, I really struggled to get the damn embroidery floss through my embroidery needle eye---And I'm not the only one! It's tricky business, but there is a hack that you will thank (nay, PRAISE) me for later.

Enter the... pinch and press method!

To thread the non-knotted end of your embroidery floss through your needle:

1. Loop the end of thread over the sharper/smaller end of the needle.
1. Just underneath the needle, pinch the loop tightly between your thumb and forefinger.
1. Remove the needle from the tight loop, pinching to allow only a teeny tiny portion of the loop to poke up above your pinched fingers.
1. Turn the needle around and carefully place your teeny tiny loop through the eye of the needle. If you've pinched it small enough, it should slide right in.
1. Pull the loop through, leaving a tail of several inches.

If all else fails, lick the end of your floss and try to poke it through the eye. I promise you the above method is easier and faster, though.

## Common stitches

It's time to dive right into stitching. I've listed some of my favorite and most-used stitches below, but do some Googling---The wild world of embroidery stitches is vast.

### Backstitch

This is [my most-used stitch](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/how-to-back-stitch). It produces clean outlines and straight lines and I just find it pleasing to look at.

### Reverse chain stitch

The [reverse chain stitch](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/how-to-chain-stitch) saved my chain stitch life. I could not, for the life of me, get the regular chain stitch to work easily and look right. When I finally did some internet research and tried the reverse chain, I breathed a sigh of relief.

### Stem stitch

This one is pretty. It's great for outlines, vines and leafy stuff, or anything you want to [look clean but have some texture](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/how-to-stem-stitch).

### Running stitch

Running stitch is the [simplest of stitches](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/working-the-running-stitch-1177571). It requires some calibration of spaces to make it look even, but really is so simple. This one might be good to start with! Then move on to the [backstitch](#backstitch).

### French knot

Some people love it, and some people hate it. I happen to _love_ [the french knot](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/how-to-french-knot). It can be painful to master (it's all about that tension, yo), but once you do it will be your funky, bumpy friend. I love to fill a space with french knots, scatter them about artistically, or accentuate my designs.

### Split stitch

[Split stitch](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/how-to-split-stitch) is performed when you split an equal number of strands while stitching. It really adds some nice texture and can also look stellar in lettering or as a filler.

### Seed stitch

Fun! Simple! Cute! [Seed stitch](https://createwhimsy.com/projects/embroidery-seed-stitch/) is your easy-to-hang-with friend. Fill a space, putter around your embroidery fabric space, or add some texture with this stitch. It's even more fun if you use multiple colors to achieve a confetti-type look.

### Satin stitch

I love the way [satin stitch](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/how-to-satin-stitch) looks and fills spaces. But for whatever reason, I have the hardest time making it look precise. It's an often used stitch by embroiderers! But I can never make it look as exacting as I want to.
