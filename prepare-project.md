# Prepare your embroidery project

Learning hand embroidery does not have to be a difficult process. You can get started with just a few common embroidery supplies.

There are numerous online resources to help you along the way with tutorials, supplies, and inspiration, including:

*  Sublime Stitching
*  Hawthorne Handmade
*  Local stitching meetups
*  Instagram

See more info about these resources in the [Resources topic](/resources.md).

## Find a design

If you're new to hand embroidery, start small---Keep the project design simple and big enough to maneuver around while also being not so big it takes you 30 hours to complete.

A simple line drawing design of about 3-5" is a good place to start. Something as simple as this landscape embroidery design would be good.

Deciding what to stitch is always daunting for me! I have so many ideas and see so much inspiration online. I use [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/shrie/stitchery/), as well as [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shrielenee/saved/), to gather drawings, designs, or inspiration that speak to me.

I sometimes buy pre-made patterns [from Sublime Stitching](https://sublimestitching.com/collections/hand-embroidery-patterns) instead of retrofitting my own. I also have a small collection of embroidery or textile craft books that I also use as templates or inspiration, such as [Yumiko Higuchi's "A Year of Embroidery"](https://www.amazon.com/Year-Embroidery-Month-Month-Collection/dp/1611804728/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1KBLR8ZPCPS8U&dchild=1&keywords=yumiko+higuchi&qid=1585332284&sprefix=yumiko+%2Caps%2C168&sr=8-3).

You can use many things as embroidery patterns, including:

*  Tattoos
*  Drawings
*  Online graphics
*  Logos or labels
*  Photos
*  Hand drawings you create yourself
*  Lettering
*  Paintings
*  Pre-made embroidery patterns (like from Sublime Stitching or Yumiko Higuchi's book)
*  Stencils

In the [Patterns folder](/patterns), I've included several pre-made patterns you can choose to start your first embroidery project.

Don't let that stop you from being creative with your own design, though! Peruse Instagram (search hashtags like `#linedrawing`, `#embroidery`, or `#beginnerembroidery`), [Google images](https://images.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl) (try searching for terms like `animal line drawing`, `floral line drawing`, or `embroidery line drawing`), or sign up for [Sublime Stitching's newsletter](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/join) to receive free patterns delivered to your email.

Designs that are very simple, like line drawings, are best to start with. Print your design, ensuring you have sized it to around 3-5" (or however big you want your stitching project to be) before printing.

## Gather materials

You will need a few basic supplies to begin your embroidery journey. Some are optional or useful, but not mandatory, and have been noted as such.

Supplies you may need include:

*  **Embroidery hoop**---Either a wooden or plastic hoop is fine. Ensure it has a tightening mechanism for keeping your fabric taut and is least 1" larger on all sides than the overall size of the design to be stitched.
*  **Embroidery needle**---These are easy to find [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=embroidery+needle&ref=nb_sb_noss_2), on the [Sublime Stitching website](https://sublimestitching.com/collections/needles), or at your local craft stores. They come in a range of sizes in multi-packs, but are larger than sewing machine needles. They have a blunter end than a regular sewing needle.
*  **Embroidery floss**---[Embroidery floss](https://sublimestitching.com/collections/threads-sublime-floss) is (typically) cotton thread that is made up of six strands. You can separate the [floss](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=embroidery+floss&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) into individual strands, or multiple strands, to achieve the right thickness and look of stitches. It is thicker, and different, than regular sewing thread.
*  **Fabric**---Cotton and linen are among the most used fabrics for hand embroidery. You can also use felt, denim, organza, tulle, card stock or postcards, or any other fabric that suits your needs. Be imaginative! When stitching, a heavier fabric will require a larger, stronger needle.
*  **Scissors**--Smaller scissors are easier to finagle loose threads with. There are [many scissors](https://sublimestitching.com/collections/type-scissors) primarily used for sewing and embroidery that are small and deft enough for embroidery purposes.
*  **Transfer pen** (optional, but recommended)---I use a transfer pen and an iron as my primary way of transferring a pattern. It is super helpful to have a [fine tip transfer pen](https://sublimestitching.com/collections/special-tools/products/transfer-pen) when transferring with a iron, though you can also use a [Pilot Frixion pen](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-FriXion-Erasable-3-Pack-31578/dp/B004JXHTDK/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=erasable+pen&qid=1585339472&sr=8-5) to draw on your fabric (marks disappear with hot iron), or a [blue transfer pen](https://www.amazon.com/DMC-U1539-Embroidery-Transfer-Blue/dp/B000W5HTX4/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=embroidery+transfer+pen&qid=1585339431&sr=8-4) (marks disappear with cold water, or over time). We'll go into more details about transferring your pattern in the [Transfer your design](#transfer-your-design) section.
*  **Needle minder** (optional)---[Needle minders](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=needle+minder&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) are two-piece magnetic tools that make it easier to keep track of your needle when you are changing the floss, tying off your floss, or having a snack!
*  **Sticky Fabri-Solvy**---[Sticky Fabri-Solvy](https://www.amazon.com/Sulky-Sticky-Fabri-Solvy-Stabilizer-8-5/dp/B004R2B3NU/ref=sr_1_26?dchild=1&keywords=embroidery+transfer+pen&qid=1585339431&sr=8-26) is a really cool tool that I don't often utilize, but plan to more in the future. You can print, copy, or draw on the material, remove the sticky backing, and then stick to your fabric. You simply stitch right over the top of both layers and then dissolve the Sticky Fabri-Solvy in water (and watch it magically disappear!) This material may be most useful with delicate fabrics like thing cotton, silk, organza, or tulle.

## Transfer your design

There are MANY ways to transfer your design to your fabric to prepare it all for stitching. Everyone has their favorite method, and mine (currently) happens to be:

1. Find a design and print it.
1. Trace it with a transfer pen.
1. Iron the design onto my fabric.

I'll go over a few ways to get your design onto the fabric so you can start stitching! Try different methods to see what works best for you and your fabric.

## Mount your fabric

## Set yourself up for success

When preparing your pattern for printing, sometimes it's helpful to lighten the color of the design (the whole image) or adjust the transparency so that it appears light in color when printed. If you plan to transfer your design to your fabric using a transfer pen (my favorite method) lightening the design will make it easier to trace it with the pen later.
