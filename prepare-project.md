# Prepare your embroidery project

Learning hand embroidery does not have to be a difficult process. You can get started with just a few common embroidery supplies.

There are numerous online resources to help you along the way with tutorials, supplies, and inspiration, including:

*  Sublime Stitching
*  Hawthorne Handmade
*  Local stitching meetups
*  Instagram

See more info about these resources in the [Resources topic](/resources.md).

## Find a design

If you're new to hand embroidery, start small---Keep the project design simple and big enough to maneuver around while also being not so big it takes you 30 hours to complete.

A simple line drawing design of about 3-5" is a good place to start. Something as simple as this landscape embroidery design would be good.

Deciding what to stitch is always daunting for me! I have so many ideas and see so much inspiration online. I use [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/shrie/stitchery/), as well as [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shrielenee/saved/), to gather drawings, designs, or inspiration that speak to me.

I sometimes buy pre-made patterns [from Sublime Stitching](https://sublimestitching.com/collections/hand-embroidery-patterns) instead of retrofitting my own. I also have a small collection of embroidery or textile craft books that I also use as templates or inspiration, such as [Yumiko Higuchi's "A Year of Embroidery"](https://www.amazon.com/Year-Embroidery-Month-Month-Collection/dp/1611804728/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1KBLR8ZPCPS8U&dchild=1&keywords=yumiko+higuchi&qid=1585332284&sprefix=yumiko+%2Caps%2C168&sr=8-3).

You can use MANY sorts of designs for embroidery projects, including:

*  Tattoos
*  Drawings
*  Online graphics
*  Logos or labels
*  Photos
*  Hand drawings you create yourself
*  Lettering
*  Paintings
*  Embroidery patterns (like from Sublime Stitching or Yumiko Higuchi's book)
*  Stencils
