# Prepare your embroidery project

Now that you have your supplies ready and you have more info about how it all will go down, you can prepare all the pieces of your embroidery puzzle.

## Prepare fabric and design

There are _many_ ways to transfer your design to your fabric to prepare it all for stitching. Everyone has their favorite method, and mine (currently) happens to be:

1. Find a design and print it.
1. Trace it with a transfer pen.
1. Iron the design onto my fabric.

Before you transfer anything, iron and pre-cut your fabric to a size that is larger than your design, but not so large you'll have to deal with a lot of extra selvage fabric on the edge as you stitch. I like to shoot for 4"-6"-ish extra fabric around the edge of my design (depending on how big my design is compared to my hoop size).

The following sections illustrate several ways that you can get your design onto your fabric of choice so you can start stitching! Try different methods to see what works best for you and your fabric.

### Iron on pre-made pattern

Ironing a pre-made pattern onto fabric is probably the easiest way to get a design ready for stitching.

This method requires that you have your pre-made pattern, an iron, and your fabric.

If you order a pre-made pattern, all you need to do is:

1. Ensure that the size of the pattern will fit on the fabric piece you chose/cut and will also fit in the hoop you're planning to mount your finished piece in.

   **Note**: The whole design does not need to fit within your working hoop space (though it's easier for beginners if it does fit). You can move the fabric around in your hoop as you go if you're working on a large design. But keep the final hoop size in mind, so that when you're done and have it mounted up the whole design will be visible.

1. Cut off any extra designs on your pattern that you do not want to transfer to your fabric.
1. Ensure the steam setting on your iron is off and the fabric setting on your iron is set to something appropriate for your fabric (put it on the linen/cotton setting for cotton fabric, and so on).
1. Pre-iron your fabric to warm it up and prepare it for receiving the design.
1. Place the pre-printed pattern _printed side down_, so the design you want to transfer is upside down against the top/right side of the fabric, and hold steadily in place.
1. Slowly and firmly iron your design back and forth, without picking up your iron from the fabric. Iron with a steady motion from the center of the design outward. Move the iron slowly and evenly over the backside of your paper pattern, taking care not to shift the fabric or the paper so you don't blur the lines of the transferred pattern.
1. After you iron over the entire design a couple of times, pick up your iron. Carefully lift up an edge of the paper, while pinning it close to the fabric with your other hand, to see if your design transferred well. If it didn't transfer clearly, carefully put the edge of the paper back down on the fabric and begin ironing again, being super careful not to shift the paper on top of the fabric.
1. Remove the paper pattern when you're done. Your design should be evenly dark and well-defined on the fabric.

### Use a transfer pen

This method requires you have a transfer pen (as mentioned in the [Supplies](#supplies) section), a design on a piece of paper, an iron, and your fabric.

When you print your design, ensure that the lines are in a light gray color or similar shade (you can crank down the opacity or transparency in your image editor to achieve this). If the lines are dark in color, it will be hard to see where you have traced!

To trace your design and transfer to fabric:

1. Follow steps one through three of the [Iron on pre-made pattern section](#iron-on-pre-made-pattern).
1. Print or draw your design onto regular paper.

   **Note**: After you trace your design, you will have to flip it over (so that the pen-traced side will be against your fabric) to transfer it to the fabric. When you do this, the design will be flipped horizontally on the fabric. So, when preparing your design on the computer, horizontally flip the image (so it appears backwards to you) before printing. Trust me on this... you'll understand why later.

1. Place your design _right/printed side up_ on a table or hard surface.
1. Using your tracing pen, carefully trace over the lines of your design. If you printed the design light enough, you should be able to see what areas you've traced over and which remain to be traced.
1. Follow steps four through seven of the [Iron on pre-made pattern section](#iron-on-pre-made-pattern).

### Draw onto fabric

I cannot draw. I do crafts, but I am _far_ from being an artist. So, this method is not for me, but may be perfect for you!

Instead of tracing and transferring and all that business, you can just draw right onto your fabric. If you are artistically inclined and can whip out a rad design, then go for it!

I recommend using either a water soluble pen or a Pilot Frixion pen, as mentioned in the [Gather materials](#gather-materials) section, so you can remove the design or revise it as you draw if need-be. Some people even use a regular pen or pencil.

Now get to drawing! It may be easier to draw directly on the fabric after you've already mounted it in a hoop. If that's your tactic, proceed to the next section, [Mount your fabric](#mount-your-fabric), and complete that before drawing on your fabric.

   **Note**: Draw on the underside of the hoop after you mount your fabric, so the fabric is flat against your table surface.

### Use Sticky Fabri-Solvy

Sticky Fabri-Solvy is pretty cool (as mentioned in the [Gather materials](#gather-materials) section). If you're working with a delicate or fine fabric, this is probably the best way to go because it adds stability to your fabric (which makes it easier to stitch).

You can print, copy, or draw right on the Sticky Fabri-Solvy material. Then, just remove the paper backing and stick to your fabric [mounted up in a hoop](#mount-your-fabric). You can reposition and smooth wrinkles as you go---no worries!

Stitch right over the Sticky Fabri-Solvy layer as you would on a lone piece of fabric. When you're all done you can dip your fabric (with stitching and Sticky Fabr-Solvy material) into a bowl of water and watch the Sticky Fabri-Solvy dissolve away.

## Mount your fabric

Well, well, well... you have a design on your fabric and you're (sorta) ready to rock! What's next? Mount that baby up.

To mount the fabric on your hoop:

1. Loosen the tightening screw mechanism on the hoop and separate the inner ring (with no mechanism) from the outer ring (with the tightening mechanism).
1. Place the inner ring on a flat table surface.
1. Place your fabric down with the design centered over the inner ring.

   If your design is bigger than your hoop, place the design you want to start working first over the middle of the inner ring.

1. Place the outer ring on top of the inner ring and fabric, sandwiching the fabric in the middle.
1. Lightly press the outer ring down until it snaps into place on the inner ring.
1. Tighten the screw so that the inner and outer rings become more tightly fitted together.
1. Adjust the fabric by gently pulling it taut around the embroidery hoop. Alternate tightening the screw with gently pulling the fabric taut until the surface of the fabric feels like a drum, but isn't so tight it's pulling at the fabric a crazy amount or distorting the weave of the fabric.
1. Once you have your fabric placed securely, finish it up by tightening the screw to really lock the fabric in place.

Sometimes verbal instructions are hard for this type of task, so check out the pictures and video on [this WikiHow page](https://www.wikihow.com/Mount-Fabric-in-an-Embroidery-Hoop) to see this process in action.

You are almost ready to stitch.

## Set yourself up for success

Though not exhaustive, here are some tips and tricks to help get you started with your first embroidery project:

*  Assemble all needed materials ahead of time, so you don't waste time digging through craft piles to get what you need.
*  When preparing your pattern for printing, sometimes it's helpful to lighten the color of the design (the whole image) or adjust the transparency so that it appears light in color when printed. If you plan to transfer your design to your fabric using a transfer pen (my favorite method) lightening the design will make it easier to trace it with the pen later.
*  Wash and iron that fabric first! Clean, pre-washed, and wrinkle-free fabric on your hoop makes it much easier to get your stitch on.
*  If, when attempting to trace a design from a book or magazine to paper, you are having a hard time seeing the design underneath to trace it, tape it all up on a window! The light shining through will make it easier to see the design underneath your blank paper.
*  When mounting your fabric, ensure it is not too loose in the hoop. Loose fabric will make it more challenging to stitch, and may cause fabric or stitch warping later on. Similarly, make sure the fabric is taut, but not so tight it's spreading the weave or splitting threads of the fabric.
*  If you aren't experienced in embroidery, I suggest you start by embroidering on quilter's weight or medium weight cotton, or a cotton linen blend. These fabrics have an appropriately spaced weave and are easy to handle and stitch.
*  If you are planning to draw your design freehand onto your fabric, after you have the fabric mounted on the hoop, flip the hoop over (so it forms a bowl of sorts, with the outer ring on the underside against the table). This way, you can draw against the fabric, flat against a table surface. Try it and you'll understand what I mean!
