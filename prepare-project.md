# Prepare your embroidery project

Learning hand embroidery does not have to be a difficult process. You can get started with just a few common embroidery supplies.

There are numerous online resources to help you along the way with tutorials, supplies, and inspiration, including:

*  Sublime Stitching
*  Hawthorne Handmade
*  Local stitching meetups
*  Instagram

See more info about these resources in the [Resources topic](/resources.md).

## Find a design

If you're new to hand embroidery, start small---Keep the project design simple and big enough to maneuver around while also being not so big it takes you 30 hours to complete.

A simple line drawing design of about 3-5" is a good place to start. Something as simple as this landscape embroidery design would be good.

Deciding what to stitch is always daunting for me! I have so many ideas and see so much inspiration online. I use [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/shrie/stitchery/), as well as [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shrielenee/saved/), to gather drawings, designs, or inspiration that speak to me.

I sometimes buy pre-made patterns [from Sublime Stitching](https://sublimestitching.com/collections/hand-embroidery-patterns) instead of retrofitting my own. I also have a small collection of embroidery or textile craft books that I also use as templates or inspiration, such as [Yumiko Higuchi's "A Year of Embroidery"](https://www.amazon.com/Year-Embroidery-Month-Month-Collection/dp/1611804728/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1KBLR8ZPCPS8U&dchild=1&keywords=yumiko+higuchi&qid=1585332284&sprefix=yumiko+%2Caps%2C168&sr=8-3).

You can use many things as embroidery patterns, including:

*  Tattoos
*  Drawings
*  Online graphics
*  Logos or labels
*  Photos
*  Hand drawings you create yourself
*  Lettering
*  Paintings
*  Pre-made embroidery patterns (like from Sublime Stitching or Yumiko Higuchi's book)
*  Stencils

In the [Patterns folder](/patterns), I've included several pre-made patterns you can choose to start your first embroidery project.

Don't let that stop you from being creative with your own design, though! Peruse Instagram (search hashtags like `#linedrawing`, `#embroidery`, or `#beginnerembroidery`), [Google images](https://images.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl) (try searching for terms like `animal line drawing`, `floral line drawing`, or `embroidery line drawing`), or sign up for [Sublime Stitching's newsletter](https://sublimestitching.com/pages/join) to receive free patterns delivered to your email.

Designs that are very simple, like line drawings, are best to start with. Print your design, ensuring you have sized it to around 3-5" (or however big you want your stitching project to be) before printing.

## Gather materials

You will need a few basic supplies to begin your embroidery journey. Some are optional or useful, but not mandatory, and have been noted as such.

Supplies you may need include:

*  **Embroidery hoop**---Either a wooden or plastic hoop is fine. Ensure it has a tightening mechanism for keeping your fabric taut and is least 1" larger on all sides than the overall size of the design to be stitched. I use a plastic hoop as my _working hoop_ and then mount it in a wooden one (that I sometimes stain!) when I'm finished stitching.
*  **Embroidery needle**---These are easy to find [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=embroidery+needle&ref=nb_sb_noss_2), on the [Sublime Stitching website](https://sublimestitching.com/collections/needles), or at your local craft stores. They come in a range of sizes in multi-packs, but are larger than sewing machine needles. They have a blunter end than a regular sewing needle.
*  **Embroidery floss**---[Embroidery floss](https://sublimestitching.com/collections/threads-sublime-floss) is (typically) cotton thread that is made up of six strands. You can separate the [floss](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=embroidery+floss&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) into individual strands, or multiple strands, to achieve the right thickness and look of stitches. It is thicker, and different, than regular sewing thread.
*  **Fabric**---Cotton and linen are among the most used fabrics for hand embroidery. You can also use felt, denim, organza, tulle, card stock or postcards, or any other fabric that suits your needs. Be imaginative! When stitching, a heavier fabric will require a larger, stronger needle.
*  **Scissors**--Smaller scissors are easier to finagle loose threads with. There are [many scissors](https://sublimestitching.com/collections/type-scissors) primarily used for sewing and embroidery that are small and deft enough for embroidery purposes.
*  **Transfer pen** (optional, but recommended)---I use a transfer pen and an iron as my primary way of transferring a pattern. It is super helpful to have a [fine tip transfer pen](https://sublimestitching.com/collections/special-tools/products/transfer-pen) when transferring with a iron, though you can also use a [Pilot Frixion pen](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-FriXion-Erasable-3-Pack-31578/dp/B004JXHTDK/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=erasable+pen&qid=1585339472&sr=8-5) to draw on your fabric (marks disappear with hot iron), or a [blue transfer pen](https://www.amazon.com/DMC-U1539-Embroidery-Transfer-Blue/dp/B000W5HTX4/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=embroidery+transfer+pen&qid=1585339431&sr=8-4) (marks disappear with cold water, or over time). We'll go into more details about transferring your pattern in the [Transfer your design](#transfer-your-design) section.
*  **Needle minder** (optional)---[Needle minders](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=needle+minder&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) are two-piece magnetic tools that make it easier to keep track of your needle when you are changing the floss, tying off your floss, or having a snack!
*  **Sticky Fabri-Solvy**---[Sticky Fabri-Solvy](https://www.amazon.com/Sulky-Sticky-Fabri-Solvy-Stabilizer-8-5/dp/B004R2B3NU/ref=sr_1_26?dchild=1&keywords=embroidery+transfer+pen&qid=1585339431&sr=8-26) is a really cool tool that I don't often utilize, but plan to more in the future. You can print, copy, or draw on the material, remove the sticky backing, and then stick to your fabric. You simply stitch right over the top of both layers and then dissolve the Sticky Fabri-Solvy in water (and watch it magically disappear!) This material may be most useful with delicate fabrics like thing cotton, silk, organza, or tulle.

## Transfer your design

There are MANY ways to transfer your design to your fabric to prepare it all for stitching. Everyone has their favorite method, and mine (currently) happens to be:

1. Find a design and print it.
1. Trace it with a transfer pen.
1. Iron the design onto my fabric.

Before you transfer anything, iron and pre-cut your fabric to a size that is larger than your design, but not so large you'll have to deal with a lot of extra selvage fabric on the edge as you stitch. I like to shoot for 4"-6"-ish extra fabric around the edge of my design.

I'll go over a few ways to get your design onto the fabric so you can start stitching! Try different methods to see what works best for you and your fabric.

### Iron on pre-made pattern

Ironing a pre-made pattern onto fabric is probably the easiest way to get the design ready for stitching.

This method requires that you have your pre-made pattern, an iron, and your fabric.

If you order a pre-made pattern, all you need to do is:

1. Ensure that the size of the pattern will fit on the fabric piece you chose/cut and will also fit in the hoop you're planning to mount your finished piece in.

   **Note**: The whole design does not need to fit within your working hoop space---you can move the fabric around in your hoop as you go if you're working on a large design. But keep the final hoop size in mind, so that when you're done and have it mounted up all pretty the whole design will be visible.

1. Cut off any extra designs on your pattern that you do not want to transfer to your fabric.
1. Ensure the steam setting on your iron is off and the fabric setting is appropriate for your fabric (put it on the linen/cotton setting for cotton fabric, and so on), then iron your fabric.
1. Place pre-printed pattern printed side down and hold steadily in place.
1. Slowly iron your design, without picking up your iron, from the center of the design outward. Move the iron slowly and evenly over your the backside of your paper pattern, taking care not to shift the fabric while doing so (so you don't blur the lines of your pattern).
1. After you have ironed over the entire design, place your iron away from the fabric. Carefully lift up an edge of the paper to see if your design has transferred well. If it looks good, proceed. If it didn't transfer clearly, carefully put the edge of the paper back down on the fabric and begin ironing again, being super careful not to shift the paper on top of the fabric.
1. Remove the paper pattern when you're done. Your design should be evenly dark and well-defined on the fabric.

### Use a transfer pen

This method requires you have a transfer pen (as mentioned in the [Supplies](#supplies) section), a printed pattern design, an iron, and your fabric.

When you print your design, ensure that the lines are in a gray color or similar. If the lines are dark in color, it will be hard to see where you have traced later on!

To trace your own design and transfer to fabric:

1. Follow steps one through three of the [Iron on pre-made pattern section](#iron-on-pre-made-pattern).
1. Print your design onto regular paper.

   **Note**: After you trace your design, you will have to flip it over (so that the pen-traced side will be against your fabric) to transfer it to the fabric. When you do this, the design will be flipped horizontally on the fabric. So, when preparing your design on the computer, horizontally flip the image (so it appears backwards to you) before printing. Trust me on this... you'll understand why later. Learn how to flip an image [in Photoshop](https://skylum.com/how-to/how-to-flip-image-in-photoshop) or [in Preview](https://osxdaily.com/2009/12/04/rotate-multiple-pictures-easily-in-mac-os-x-with-preview/).

1. Place your printed pattern printed side up on a table or hard surface.
1. Using your tracing pen, carefully trace over the lines of your design. If you printed the design light enough, you should be able to see what areas you've traced over and which are left to be done.
1. Follow steps four through seven of the [Iron on pre-made pattern section](#iron-on-pre-made-pattern).

### Draw onto fabric

I cannot draw. I do crafts, but I am _far_ from being an artist. So, this method is not for me, but may be perfect for you!

Instead of tracing and transferring and all that business, you can just draw right on your fabric. If you are artistically inclined and can whip out a rad design, then go for it!

I recommend using either a water soluble pen or a Pilot Frixion pen (as mentioned in the [Gather materials](#gather-materials section)) so you can remove the design, or revise it as you draw, if need-be.

With that said, draw away! It may be easier to draw directly on the fabric after you've already mounted it in a hoop. Proceed to the next section, [Mount your fabric](#mount-your-fabric) and complete that before drawing.

### Use Sticky Fabri-Solvy

Sticky Fabri-Solvy is pretty cool (as mentioned in the [Gather materials](#gather-materials) section). If you're working with a delicate or fine fabric, this is probably the best way to go because it adds stability to your fabric (which makes it easier to stitch).

You can print, copy, or draw right on the Sticky Fabri-Solvy material. The, just remove the paper backing and stick to your fabric. You can reposition and smooth wrinkles as you go---no worries!

Stitch right over the Sticky Fabri-Solvy layer as you would on a lone piece of fabric. When you're ALL done you can dip your fabric (with stitching and Sticky Fabr-Solvy material) into a bowl of water and watch the Sticky Fabr-Solvy dissolve away.

## Mount your fabric

Well, well, well... you have a design on your fabric and you're (sorta) ready to rock! What's next? Mount that baby up.

To mount your fabric on your hoop:

1. Loosen the tightening screw mechanism on the hoop and separate the inner ring (with no mechanism) from the outer ring (with the tightening mechanism).
1. Place the inner ring on a flat table surface.
1. Place your fabric down with the design centered over the inner ring.

   If your design is bigger than your hoop, place the design you want to start working first over the middle of the inner ring.

1. Place the outer ring on top of the inner ring and fabric, sandwiching the fabric in the middle.
1. Lightly press the outer ring down until it snaps back into place on the inner ring.
1. Tighten the screw so that the inner and outer rings become more tightly fitted together.
1. Adjust the fabric by gently pulling it taut around the embroidery hoop. Alternate tightening the screw with gently pulling the fabric taut until the surface of the fabric feels like a drum (but isn't so tight it's pulling at the fabric a crazy amount).
1. Finish it up by tightening the screw to secure the fabric in place.

Sometimes verbal instructions are hard for this type of task, so check out the pictures and video on [this WikiHow page](https://www.wikihow.com/Mount-Fabric-in-an-Embroidery-Hoop) to see this process in action.

You are almost ready to get stitchin'.

## Set yourself up for success

Though not exhaustive, here are some tips and tricks to help get you started on the first foot for your first embroidery project:

*  Assemble all needed materials ahead of time, so you don't waste time digging through craft piles to get what you need.
*  When preparing your pattern for printing, sometimes it's helpful to lighten the color of the design (the whole image) or adjust the transparency so that it appears light in color when printed. If you plan to transfer your design to your fabric using a transfer pen (my favorite method) lightening the design will make it easier to trace it with the pen later.
*  If, when attempting to trace a printed design onto paper, you are having a hard time seeing the design underneath to trace it, tape it all up on a window! The light shining through will make it easier to see your printed design underneath your blank paper.
*  When mounting your fabric ensure it is not too loose in the hoop. This will make it more challenging to stitch, and may cause fabric or stitch warping later on. Similarly, make sure the fabric is taut but not tight enough it's spreading the weave or splitting threads of the fabric.
*  If you aren't experienced in embroidery, I suggest you start by embroidering quilter's weight or medium weight cotton, or a cotton linen blend. These fabrics have an appropriately spaced weave and are easy to handle and stitch.
