Embroidery seems like an old-school craft, but the possibilities are limitless. Stitchers like X are doing really interesting things with hand embroidery. 

Once you have the technique down, and find your groove in regards to preparing all your materials, you can really get creative with your ideas and execution! For instance, I made postcards with with card stock and  images cut from magazines, gift wrap, artwork, etc. that I mod-podged together and then stitched designs over the top of that.

## Inspiration

Now that I've been embroidering for a little while I see inspiration for stitching EVERYWHERE. I have too many ideas to keep up with, actually! I'm a slow stitcher but I also enjoy gathering inspirational resources so when I'm ready to pick up another project I don't have to spend time figuring that part out.

Look for inspiration in these places:

*  **Outdoors**---Don't discount the genius of mother nature. Look for patterns, landscapes, designs, and inspiration right outside your door then draw it up for a stitching design. You can _even_ [stitch on fallen leaves](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk01i4SGIH1tMr_wl036_FH_AT6vCpA:1586024732669&q=embroidery+on+leaves&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjItq7Gss_oAhUDUKwKHSJkA7AQsAR6BAgJEAE&biw=1494&bih=891) if you're fancy.
